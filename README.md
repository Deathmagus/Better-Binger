# Better Binger 
v.0.4.0

This is a small set of Greasemonkey user scripts designed to make catching up on your unread Comic-Rocket.com comics an easy and enjoyable process.  Each day, Better Binger analyzes your comic backlog and generates a to-read list - with as much or as little variety as you would like.  Now, instead of buckling down to complete an overwhelming 3000-page archive before moving on to the next 3000-page archive, Better Binger will serve up a smattering of the comics you need to catch up on the most - exactly as many as you want to read.

In the future, you can also expect some statistics tracking your pace and progress, as well as more robust UI features to fully integrate the script with the Comic-Rocket website.

## Getting Started
1.  Make sure that either [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox) or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (Chrome) is installed on your browser of choice.
2.  Install from GitHub's [master branch](https://github.com/Deathmagus/Better-Binger/raw/master/Better_Binger.user.js).  The [develop branch](https://github.com/Deathmagus/Better-Binger/raw/develop/Better_Binger.user.js) should be stable as well, though new features may be incomplete.
3.  Visit the [My Comics](https://www.comic-rocket.com/) page on Comic-Rocket.com to get started - you should see a new link at the top of your "Pages to Read" section.
