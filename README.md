# Better Binger
A better way to catch up on your Comic-Rocket backlog.

This is a small set of Greasemonkey user scripts designed to make catching up on massive webcomic backlogs on Comic-Rocket.com an easy and enjoyable process.  Each day, Better Binger analyzes your comic backlog according to rules you specify, and generates and guides you through a to-read list - with as much or as little variety as you would like.  Now, instead of buckling down to clear an overwhelming 3000-page archive before moving on to the next 3000-page archive, Better Binger will serve up a smattering of comics you need to catch up on the most - exactly as many as you want to read.

In the future, you can also expect some statistics tracking your pace and progress, as well as more robust UI features to fully integrate the script with the Comic-Rocket website.
